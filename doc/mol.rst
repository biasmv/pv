Molecular Structures
=========================================================================================

Molecular structures are represented by the :class:`mol.Mol` class. While nothing restricts the type of molecules stored in an instance of :class:`mol.Mol`, the data structure is optimized for biological macromolecules and follows the same hierarchical organizing principle. The lowest level of the hierarchy is formed by chains. The chains consist of one or more residues. Depending on the type of residues the chain holds, the chain is interpreted as a linear chain of residues, e.g. a polyeptide, or polynucleotide, or a collection of an unordered group of molecules such as water. In the former case, residues are ordered from N to C terminus, whereas in the latter the ordering of the molecules does not carry any meaning. Each residue consists of one or more atoms.

Tightly coupled to :class:`mol.Mol` is the concept of structural subset, a :class:`mol.MolView`. MolViews have the exact same interface than :class:`mol.Mol` and in most cases behave exactly the same. Thus, from a user perspective it mostly does not matter whether one is working with a complete structure or a subset thereof. In the following, the APIs for the :class:`mol.Mol` and :class:`mol.MolView` classes are described together. Where differences exist, they are documented.


Obtaining and Creating Molecular Structures
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most common way to construct :class:`molecules <mol.Mol>` is through one of the io functions. For example, to import the structure from a PDB file, use :func:`io.pdb`. The whole structure, or a subset thereof can then be displayed on the screen by using one of the :ref:`rendering functions<pv.viewer.rendering>`.

The following code example fetches a PDB file from PDB.org imports it and displays the chain with name 'A' on the screen. For more details on how to create subsets, see :ref:`mol.creating-views`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  $.ajax('http://pdb.org/pdb/files/'+pdbId+'.pdb')
  .done(function(data) {
      // data contains the contents of the PDB file in text form
      var structure = io.pdb(data);
      var firstChain = structure.select({chain: 'A'});
      viewer.cartoon('firstChain', firstChain);
  });

Alternatively, you can create the structure *by hand*. That's typically not required, unless you are implementing your own importer for a custom format.  The following code creates a simple molecule consisting of 10 atoms arranged along the x-axis.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var structure = new mol.Mol();
  var chain = structure.addChain('A');
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    var residue = chain.addResidue('ABC', i);
    residue.addAtom('X', [i, 0, 0], 'C');
  }


.. _mol.creating-views:

Creating Subsets of a Molecular Structure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is quite common to only apply operations (coloring, displaying) to subset of a molecular structure. These subsets are modelled as *views* and can be created in different ways.

 - The most convenient way to create views is by using :func:`mol.Mol.select`. Select accepts a set of predicates and returns a view containing only chains, residues and atoms that match the predicates. 
 - Alternatively for more complex selections, one can use :func:`mol.Mol.residueSelect`, which evaluates a function on each residue and includes residues for which the function returns true.

 - Selection by distance allows to select parts of a molecule that are within a certain radius of  another molecule.
 - Views can be assembled manually through :func:`mol.MolView.addChain`, :func:`mol.ChainView.addResidue`, :func:`mol.ResidueView.addAtom`. This is the most flexible but also the most verbose way of creating views.




The Mol (and MolView) API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: mol.Mol()

  Represents a complete molecular structure which may consist of multiple polypeptide chains, solvent and other molecules.

.. class:: mol.MolView()

  Represents a subset of a molecular structure, e.g. the result of a selection operation. Except for a few differences, it's API is identical to :class:`mol.Mol`.

.. function:: mol.Mol.eachAtom(callback)
              mol.MolView.eachAtom(callback)

  Invoke callback for each atom in the structure. For example, the following code calculates the number of carbon alpha atoms.

  .. code-block:: javascript

    var carbonAlphaCount = 0;
    myStructure.eachAtom(function(atom) {
      if (atom.name() !== 'CA')
        return;
      if (!atom.residue().isAminoacid())
        return;
      carbonAlphaCount += 1; 
    });
    console.log('number of carbon alpha atoms', carbonAlphaCount);

.. function:: mol.Mol.eachResidue(callback)
              mol.MolView.eachResidue(callback)

  Invoke callback for each residue in the structure or view.

.. function:: mol.Mol.full()
              mol.MolView.full()

  Convenience function that always links back to :class:`mol.Mol`. For instances of :class:`mol.Mol`, returns this directly, for instances of :class:`mol.MolView` returns a reference to the :class:`mol.Mol` the subset was derived from. 

.. function:: mol.Mol.atomCount()
              mol.MolView.atomCount()

  Returns the number of atoms in the structure, subset of structure.

.. function:: mol.Mol.center()
              mol.MolView.center()

  Returns the geometric center of all atoms in the structure.

.. function:: mol.Mol.chains()
              mol.MolView.chains()

  Returns an array of all chains in the structure. For :class:`mol.Mol`, this returns a list of :class:`mol.Chain` instances, for :class:`mol.MolView` a list of :class:`mol.ChainView` instances.

.. function:: mol.Mol.select(what)
              mol.MolView.select(what)

  Returns a :class:`mol.MolView` containing a filtered subset of chains, residues and atoms. *what* determines how the filtered subset is created. It can be set to a predefined string for commonly required selections, or be set to a dictionary of predicates that have to match for a chain, residue or atom to be included in the result. Currently, the following predefined selections are accepted:

  * *water*: selects residues with names HOH and DOD (deuteriated water).
  * *protein*: returns all amino-acids found in the structure. Note that this might return amino acid ligands as well.
  * *ligand*: selects all residues which are not water nor protein.

  Matching by predicate dictionary provides a flexible way to specify selections without having to write custom callbacks. A predicate is a condition which has to be fullfilled in order to include a chain, residue or atom in the results. Some of the predicates match against chain ,e.g. *cname*, others against residues, e.g. *rname*, and others against atoms, e.g. *ele*. When multiple predicates are specified in the dictionary, all of them have to match for an item to be included in the results.

  **Available Chain Predicates:**

  * *cname*/*chain*: A chain is included iff the chain name it is equal to the *cname*/*chain*. To match against multiple chain names, use the plural forms cnames/chains.

  **Available Residue Predicates:**

  * *rname*: A residue is included iff the residue name it is equal to *rname*/*chain*. To match against multiple residue names, use the plural form rnames.
  * *rindexRange* include residues at position in a chain in the half-closed interval *rindexRange[0]* and *rindexRange[1]*. The residue at *rindexRange[1]* is not included. Indices are zero-based. 
  * *rindices* includes residues at certain positions in the chain. Indices are zero based.

  **Available Atom Predicates:**

  * *aname* An atom is included iff the atom name it is equal to *aname*. To match against multiple atom names, use the plural forms cnames/chains.

  **Examples:**

  .. code-block:: javascript

    // select chain with name 'A' and all its residues and atoms
    var chainA = myStructure.select({cname : 'A'});

    // select carbon alpha  of chain 'A'. Residues with no carbon alpha will not be
    // included in the result.
    var chainACarbonAlpha = myStructure.select({cname : 'A', aname : 'CA'});

  When none of the above selection mechanisms is flexible enough, consider using :func:`mol.Mol.residueSelect`.


  :returns: :class:`mol.MolView` containing the subset of chains, residues and atoms.

.. function:: mol.Mol.selectWithin(structure[, options])
              mol.MolView.selectWithin(structure[, options])

  :param structure: :class:`mol.Mol` or :class:`mol.MolView` to which proximity is required.
  :param options: An optional dictionary of options to control the behavior of selectWithin (see below)

  **Options**

  - **radius** sets the distance cutoff in Angstrom. The default radius is 4.   
      
  - **matchResidues** whether to use residue matching mode. When set to true, all atom of a residue are included in result as soon as one atom is in proximity.


.. function:: mol.Mol.residueSelect(predicate)
              mol.MolView.residueSelect(predicate)

  Returns an instance of :class:`mol.MolView` only containing residues which match the predicate function. The predicate must be a function which accepts a residue as its only argument and return true for residues to be included. For all other residues, the predicate must return false. All atoms of matching residues will be included in the view.

  **Example:**

  .. code-block:: javascript

    var oddResidues = structure.residueSelect(function(res) { return res.index() % 2; });

.. function:: mol.Mol.addChain(name)

  Adds a new chain with the given name to the  structure

  :returns: the newly created :class:`mol.Chain` instance

.. function:: mol.MolView.addChain(residue, includeAllResiduesAndAtoms)

  Adds the given chain to the structure view

  :param chain: the chain to add. Must either be a :class:`mol.ChainView`, or :class:`mol.Chain` instance.
  :param includeAllResiduesAndAtoms: when true, residues and atoms contained in the chain are directly added as new :class:`mol.ResidueView`, :class:`mol.AtomView` instances. When set to false (the default), the new chain view is created with an empty list of residues.

  :returns: the newly created :class:`mol.ChainView` instance


.. function:: mol.Mol.chain(name)
.. function:: mol.MolView.chain(name)

  Alias for :func:`mol.Mol.chainByName`

.. function:: mol.Mol.chainByName(name)
.. function:: mol.MolView.chainByName(name)

  Returns the chain with the given name. If no such chain exists, null is returned.

.. function:: mol.Mol.chainsByName(names)
.. function:: mol.MolView.chainsByName(names)

  Returns the list of chains matching the specified names. In case a chain does not exist (or is not part of the view), the chain name is ignored, as if it were not specified.

.. function:: io.pdb(pdbData)

  Loads a structure from the *pdbData* string and returns it. In case multiple models are present in the file (as designated by MODEL/ENDMDL), only the first is read. The following record types are handled:

   * *ATOM/HETATM* for the actual coordinate data. Alternative atom locations other than those labelled as *A* are discarded.
   * *HELIX/STRAND* for assignment of secondary structure information.
   * *REMARK 350* for handling of biological assemblies
